I am a Ph.D student at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Libin Liu](http://libliu.info/). I received my B.S. degree in electronic engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2020. 



My ultimate goal is to create **a production-ready system capable of generating film-quality animation from natural language scripts**. 



To attain this goal, I joined a startup team from 2019 to 2021 and helped develop a language-assisted animation creation product that enables users (e.g., Tiktokers and kids) to effortlessly create simple animations by specifying natural language-described story scripts. You can view some demos [here](/project/story2animation/).



Recently, I am engaged in exploring a preliminary solution path from the academic perspective. My current work focuses on a core sub-module of the script-to-animation system: **audio/text-driven human behavior motion synthesis, such as gesture generation**.
